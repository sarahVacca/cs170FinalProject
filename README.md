# cs170FinalProject
Semester Project for CS170 - Analysis of Programming Languages

Part 1: 
https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~kebasye/cs170_2022/CS170HW/CS170Proj1.html
Write a recursive descent parser for the subset of Scheme defined by the following EBNF grammar:
<s_expression> ‚ü∂ ( { <s_expression> } ) | #t | #f | <symbol> | ().
  
Part 2:

Modify your S_Expression() function so that it returns the underlying "cons-cell" structure of the list that it parses.To complement this, 
write a function printSExp(SExp s) that, given a pointer to such a cons-cell structure, will print out the list in parenthesized form. Thus, given 
a pointer to the above structure, printSExp() will print out (a b c)

If you have not already done so, be sure that your program evaluates all levels of function calls. It's a matter of having your function "eval" call itself at the correct times. In addition, for the rest of the project, be sure to continue to always evaluate arguments before evaluating a function. For example, (car (cdr '(a b c))) should return b, rather than cdr. (Of course, (car '(cdr (a b c))) WILL return cdr because the quote should continue to suppress evaluation.
This assignment sets up the necessary preliminaries for function definition. We will concentrate here on simply defining symbols to have values, which is much the same as defining constant functions. This is analogous to assigning values to variables in imperative languages.
  
Part 4:

Enhance your interpreter so that it is capable of reading user function definitions and evaluating them correctly. Function definitions in Scheme are of the form,

   (define (< function-name > < formal-parameters >)
           < s-expression >)
Note that, by contrast with definitions of symbols, the function name and the formal parameters are presented as a list. For example:
      (define (member E L)
        (cond ((null? L) #f)
              ((equal? E (car L)) L)
              (else (member E (cdr L)))))

Make your interpreter even nicer than it is now. Add the following capabilites:

(1) Arithmetic functions: +, -, *. Note that addition and multiplication take any number of arguments (e.g., (+ 3 4 5) returns 12). This will require you to recognize when an atom is a number, to convert back and forth between strings and numbers, and probably will entail the most work in this assignment.

(2) Logical functions: AND, OR and NOT. Note again that AND and OR take any number of arguments. AND returns the last value computed in its arguments, if they are all non-#f, and #f otherwise; OR returns the first non-#f argument if there is one, and #f otherwise. It's a short-circuit evaluation in both cases. NOT is just a synonym for NULL?.

(3) Relational operators: <, >. Naturally, these apply only to numbers.

(4) Other miscellaneous functions which you may not have added yet:

list : Takes any number of arguments and returns a list of them. For example, (list 'a 'b 'c) returns (a b c).

cadr, caddr, cadddr and caddddr : Returns the second, third, fourth.... element of a list, respectively.

list? : A predicate that returns #t if the argument is a list, #f otherwise.

number? : A predicate that returns #t if the argument is a number, #f otherwise.

last : return the last item of a list.

length : return the length of a list.
